# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems.  
Most of the problems are currently from the **Easy** category, implemented in **Java**.

📝 I also maintain a tracking file:  
- 📊 [`LeetcodeCodings.xlsx`](./LeetcodeCodings.xlsx) — where I keep track of solved problems and plan upcoming ones.
